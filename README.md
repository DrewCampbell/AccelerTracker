AccelerTracker
==============
This program allows the user to track the values for the X, Y and Z accelerometers in their android device.  After starting the application, select 'Track' and then 'Start' from the top menu. The application will currently store the X, Y and Z values overa period of time (currently set to every 100 milliseconds).  To stop tracking, select 'Track' and then 'Stop'.  The screen will automatically change to a graph showing the X, Y and Z values of the period of tracking time. The graph length will automatically adjust for the size of your android device screen.
